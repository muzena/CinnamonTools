I had to add the **icons** folder with three icons that might not exist on older versions of most icons themes. The icons are from the Adwaita icon theme version 3.18.

I had to use the **3.0** folder because the moronic system uses the **2.8** folder on Cinnamon 3.0.x instead of using the files on the root folder. Just in case the system continues to be a moron, I also added the **3.4** folder to force that version of Cinnamon to use the files found on the root.

The **applet.js** file on the **2.8** folder is based on the default applet that comes with Cinnamon 2.8.8.

The rest of all the **applet.js** files are exactly the same and are based on the default applet that comes with Cinnamon 3.2.x.

All the **settings-schema.json** files are exactly the same.
