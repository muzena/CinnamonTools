## Change Log

**Note:** Upstream fixes/features are changes made to the original Cinnamon Menu applet that I ported to this applet.

##### 1.21
- Changed *multiversion* implementation. Created symlinks inside the version folder so I don't keep forgetting to copy the files from the root folder. The only *unique* file, and the only reason that I use *multiversion*, is the settings-schema.json file.
- Changed the way the imports are done.
- Implemented some of the upstream features and fixes.

##### 1.20
- Added Czech localization. Thanks to [Radek71](https://github.com/Radek71).

- Fixed keyboard navigation in the Favorites box caused by a custom separator element.
